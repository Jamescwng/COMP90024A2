units and belt filter presses. The treatment processes are designed to remove solids and pathogens and biologically reduce organic and nutrient loads.\n\u2022 ASRP comprises of mainly Ultrafiltration (UF) and two passes of Reverse Osmosis (RO) filtration processes. The ASRP operations involve treatment of tertiary treated effluent from ATP to produce Class A fit-for-purpose recycled water for industrial and irrigation customers. The effluent (brine or the Reverse Osmosis Concentrate (ROC)) from ASRP is combined with the excess tertiary treated effluent from ATP before the mixture is discharged to the Port Philip Bay. The ASRP is a salt reduction plant has recently been recommissioned to supply Class A recycled water to Industrial and Irrigation customers in accordance with the regional EIP, Recycled Water Quality Management Plan (RWQMP) and individual customer EIPs. \nThe ATP operations involve treatment of municipal sewage (about 99% residential) to produce tertiary treated effluent and digested sludge (biosolids).
